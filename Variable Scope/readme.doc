Variable Scope
---------

Scope

Task instructions
You task in this activity is to declare a variable inside the function yourPet defined in the scope.js file located inside the scope folder.

Note that there are two functions, myPet and yourPet, both return an animal. However, the value of the animal 
returned by yourPet should be different than the one myPet returns.

To accomplish this task, note the following:

You cannot hard-code return 'cat' inside the yourPetfunction.
yourPet must return a variable named animal.
yourPet should not reassign the existing animal variable declared on the first line (in the global scope).
Hint: Remember that variables declared inside a function are within the function's scope.
