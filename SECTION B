What We Should Be Thinking About When We Code

Create your own real-world mental model of a computer using analogies for the CPU, stack, heap, machine instructions, and input and output. 

For example: 

Input: A waitress brings a food order to the kitchen. 

CPU: The chef. He sees the order is for a large lasagna. 

Machine instructions:  Small individual steps the chef needs to take to make the lasagna.

Such as:

Boil water
Make ricotta cheese stuffing
Cook noodles
Assemble lasagna in layers
Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes
Stack: The cooking process to create the dish, which has several interrelated steps to be executed one at a time.  
For example, Step 2: Making ricotta cheese stuffing may have a subsection of melting butter, which he must do before 
proceeding with the much larger task of finishing the cheese stuffing. The process stops at some points and starts 
again at others depending on what he must do next to cook the food. 

Heap:  It is where individual ingredients are stored, like a pantry or a refrigerator.  The ingredients for lasagna 
are noodles and sauce stored in the pantry, and cheese stored in the fridge. The ingredients for a JavaScript program
are objects, arrays, strings, numbers, etc., and they are stored in the computer’s memory. 

Output: The finished lasagna, which the waitress brings to the customer. 

Be creative, have fun, and don’t worry about getting it absolutely right or perfect. You will refine this mental model as you go along!
