In Week 3: Mental Model of Computing Operations, you will distinguish between data types and 
explain how scope impacts their storage and execution. You will learn how to define objects and
when to pass an object, a local variable, or global variable into a function. You will also practice 
debugging your code, which will help you solve errors that may appear in your code. This is an essential 
skill for programmers. By the end of this week, you will be able to implement web animations using JavaScript. 

This foundations week is designed to reinforce foundational programming concepts in JavaScript. If you are
an experienced programmer in JavaScript or in another language, we encourage you to skip ahead to the coding 
assignments, then review the videos and activities if you need more practice.
