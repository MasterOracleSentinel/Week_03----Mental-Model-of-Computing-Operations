Task instructions
Open the equals-operator-01 folder, select the soccer-manager.js file and work on the arrays assignment.

A soccer coach is trying to come up with the best "playing style" strategy to make his team play in 2 soccer league cups.
He has 2 available sets of players: firstTeam and secondTeam.
Let's help the manager set the best playing style. He has to choose between two possible positions for his teams:
3, 3, 1, 3 formation
4, 1, 4, 1 formation
Declare a function called getPlayingStyle with no arguments
Inside the function define 2 array variables, firstTeam and secondTeam
Set firstTeam equal to the following array elements [3,3,1,3]
Set secondTeam equal to firstTeam

However, if the game becomes more challenging, the manager will opt for a more aggressive style of play, the [4,1,4,1] style.

Change the playingstyle by setting firstTeam to the following new values:

first element to 4
second element to 1
third element to 4
fourth element to 1
Finally, return secondTeam array.

Hint: Remember that arrays are zero indexed.

Do you think secondTeam has kept the same playing style or introduced a different one?
Run the code in the console to find out what secondTeam's final playing style is.
Check your task when complete.
