Object Assignment vs. Primitive Assignment
We're about to learn how primitive assignment works and how it's different from object assignment.

Primitives vs. objects
Let's recall the different primitive types and objects in JavaScript.

Primitive types: number, string, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol

Object types: Object, array, date

How we assign values to primitive types
Assigning a primitive value to a variable is pretty direct. The value is assigned to the variable.

Object assignment
Object assignment works differently. This is what happens when we assign an object to a variable:

It creates an object in memory (heap)
It assigns a reference to that object and stores that reference in a variable

Note: Be careful when copying objects; this can be unintended, and you may get unexpected results.

Task instructions
Open the equals-operator.js file and create the array scottishCity and the variable americanCity. 

Re-assign the array to the americanCity variable. Find out the results.

Task instructions
Open the equals-operator-01 folder, select the soccer-manager.js file and work on the arrays assignment.

A soccer coach is trying to come up with the best "playing style" strategy to make his team play in 2 soccer league cups.
He has 2 available sets of players: firstTeam and secondTeam.
Let's help the manager set the best playing style. He has to choose between two possible positions for his teams:
3, 3, 1, 3 formation
4, 1, 4, 1 formation
Declare a function called getPlayingStyle with no arguments
Inside the function define 2 array variables, firstTeam and secondTeam
Set firstTeam equal to the following array elements [3,3,1,3]
Set secondTeam equal to firstTeam

However, if the game becomes more challenging, the manager will opt for a more aggressive style of play, the [4,1,4,1] style.

Change the playingstyle by setting firstTeam to the following new values:

first element to 4
second element to 1
third element to 4
fourth element to 1
Finally, return secondTeam array.

Hint: Remember that arrays are zero indexed.

Do you think secondTeam has kept the same playing style or introduced a different one?
Run the code in the console to find out what secondTeam's final playing style is.
Check your task when complete.
